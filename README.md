# Multiple_Sclerosis_Lesion_Segmentation
## Abstract 
This paper presents a light weighted fully convolutional
network based automated method for multiple sclerosis(
MS) lesion segmentation from multimodal magnetic resonance
(MR) scans which reduces the complexity of U-Net architecture
and training time with significant extent.

## INTRODUCTION
MS is a long-term, or persistent, condition that affects the
central nervous system (CNS) which often leads to disability. The CNS is made up of optic nerve, brain and spinal cord.
Hardening of tissue in the body is defined as sclerosis. In MS,
scar tissue appears in the CNS. This leads to travelling of
messages between the brain and rest of the body in an uneven
way.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool in diagnosing
MS. It can reveal telltale scars, also called lesions, on the brain or
spinal cord.
MRI allows doctors to see lesions in your Central Nervous
System(CNS). Lesions show up as white or dark spots, depending on
the type of scan.
